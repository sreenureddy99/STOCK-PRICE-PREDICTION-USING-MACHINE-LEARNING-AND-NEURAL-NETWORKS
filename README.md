## STOCK PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING AND NEURAL NETWORKS
A application to predict the stock price prediction
## About
Stock price prediction using machine learning is the process of predicting the future value of stocks traded on the stock market in order to earn profits. Due to the many factors involved in forecasting stock prices, it is challenging to predict stock prices with high accuracy, and this is where machine learning plays a vital role. By treating stock data as a time series, past stock prices (and other parameters) can be used to forecast stock prices for the next day or week. Machine learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or LSTM are popular models applied to predict time series data such as weather forecast, election results, house prices and of course stock prices. The goal is to weigh the importance of recent and older data and determine which parameters most affect the "current" or "next" day's prices. A machine learning model assigns weights to each market function and determines what history the model should look at to predict future stock prices.

## Result
The Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks are able to provide accuracy of greater than ninety percent, compared to the fifty percent accuracy provided by the basic ML algorithms. If the model is trained with greater number of datasets using higher computing capacities, an increased number of layers and LSTM modules, the prediction can be more reliable.
The prediction of the Stock Price is very beneficial in picking a Stock for the trade, when it is backed up with proper fundamental analysis.
